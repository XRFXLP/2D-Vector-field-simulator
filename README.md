# 2D-Vector-field-simulator
You can change the vector field here:

 `loc.x += loc.x/70 ;
  loc.y += loc.y/70 ;`
  
For example in this case, the `x` component of vector field is `x/70` and similarly for `y` component of vector field is `y/70`. As you might have guessed `loc.x` return current `x` component of location.
